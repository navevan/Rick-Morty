        The Effects of Alcholism
      </h2>
      <p>
        -The impact of drinking on family life can include substantial mental health problems for other family members, such as anxiety, fear and depression.
      </br>
        -Drinking outside the home can mean less time spent at home.
      </br>
        -Heavy drinking has been strongly linked to violence between partners and to a lesser extent to violence towards others, possibly because proximity increases the opportunities for violence.
      </br>
        -Depression can be a contributing factor to alcohol consumption. This in turn creates a negtive feedback loop
      </br>
        -Comorbidity of social phobia in excessive alcohol users is quite common. Changes in personality such as increased irritability, impaired reasoning and poor judgment are said to be consequences of excessive alcohol use
